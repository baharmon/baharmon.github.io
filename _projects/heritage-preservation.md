We are using lidar, photogrammetry, and radiance fields to 3D scan 
historic landscapes, buildings, and artifacts.
Our aim is to create 
immersive, minutely detailed digital archives
of these heritage sites.
Our server 
<i class="ms ms-cloud"></i>
[xyz.cct.lsu.edu](https://xyz.cct.lsu.edu/)
hosts a growing collection of point clouds
using Potree
for interative point cloud rendering.

## Atlas of Heritage Trees

![Heritage Trees](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/baharmon/baharmon.github.io/master/images/heritage-preservation/heritage-trees.jpg)

[The Atlas of Heritage Trees](https://xyz.cct.lsu.edu/atlas-of-heritage-trees/)
is an archive of ancient trees
of exceptional historical, cultural, and ecological significance.
The trees, captured using terrestrial laser scanning and drone lidar,
have been archived in
``laz``, ``e57``, ``pcd``, ``xyz``, and ``3dm`` format point clouds.
This project was funded by the LSU Arts & Humanities Support Fund.
The project leads are Brendan Harmon
and Hye Yeon Nam.
Contributors include 
Javier Zamora, 
Huan Guo, 
William Reinhardt, 
Julie Whitbeck, 
Kaiti Fink, 
and Jeff Boucher.
The point clouds are released under the

[African American Burial Grounds](https://xyz.cct.lsu.edu/african-american-burial-grounds/)
&nbsp;
This project aims to document 
African American burial grounds 
in the Louisiana River Parishes. 
The Louisiana River Parishes
are scattered with hundreds of 
African American cemeteries
dating back to the antebellum period
when plantations lined both sides of the Mississippi River.
This history of environmental racism
continued into the 20th century
as the region was favored for
hazardous petrochemical production facilities. 
Today these cultural landscapes are threatened by 
industrial expansion, climate change, missing land-tenure records, 
and dwindling populations of descendant communities.
Our team is 3D scanning burial grounds
and compiling a database of 
interactive, publicly accessible digital models
to preserve the record of these cultural landscapes.
The project leads are Annicia Streete, 
Brendan Harmon, and Nicholas Serrano.
This research is funded by a National Park Service
Preservation Technology and Training Grant.
The point clouds are released under the

## Rosedown

![Rosedown Dining Room](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/baharmon/baharmon.github.io/master/images/heritage-preservation/rosedown-dining-room.jpg)

[Rosedown](https://xyz.cct.lsu.edu/rosedown/)
is a two hundred acre site in St. Francisville, Louisiana
with the well preserved remains of an antebellum plantation dating from 1834
including the main house, ancillary buildings, and formal gardens.
The plantation was documented
using terrestrial laser scanning with a Faro Focus
and drone photogrammetry with a DJI Matrice 600 Pro with Zenmuse X5 camera.
The project was lead by
Brendan Harmon and
Nicholas Serrano.
The team included Josef Horacek, Sasha Matthieu, William Conrad,
Javier Zamora, Matthew Cranney, and Ming Li.
This project was supported by the
LSU Center for GeoInformatics and
LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio
and funded by the National Park Service's Historic Preservation Fund.

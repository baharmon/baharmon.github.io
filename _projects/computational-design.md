## Book

<!--<i class="fas fa-book"></i>-->
[Computational Design for Landscape Architects](https://www.routledge.com/Computational-Design-for-Landscape-Architects/Harmon/p/book/9781032407050)
&nbsp;
This book is a guide to computational design for landscape architects replete with extensive tutorials. It introduces algorithmic approaches for modeling and designing landscapes. The aim of this book is to use algorithms to understand and design landscape as a generative system, i.e. to harness the processes that shape landscape to generate new forms. An algorithmic approach to design is gently introduced through visual programming with Grasshopper, before more advanced methods are taught in Python, a high-level programming language. Topics covered include parametric design, randomness and noise, waves and attractors, lidar, point cloud modeling, terrain modeling, earthworks, digital fabrication, and more. The chapters include sections on theory, methods, and either visual programming or scripting.

## Designs

**Cloud Garden** is a computational design for a garden generated from procedural noise and modeled as a point cloud. All of the plants in the garden are either laser scanned or neural rendered specimens collected in the wild.

[**Cloud Forest**](https://xyz.cct.lsu.edu/cloud-forest/)
is a collection of laser scanned trees and other plants.
Each plant is available as 
``laz``, ``e57``, ``ply``, ``pcd``, ``xyz``, and ``3dm`` 
format point clouds released under the

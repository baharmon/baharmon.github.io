## Robotic Planting

**Robotic Planting** 
&nbsp;
We are developing robotic processes
for planting seeds in algorithmically generated designs. 
In the first phase of this project
we developed a method for robotically extruding seeds
in a paste of clay and planting media. 
As a proof of concept 
we demonstrated how algorithms can generate 
precise planting patterns such as pseudorandom gradients.
We are investigating alternative planting processes,
integrating sensors into the system,
and integrating the system onto an unmanned ground vehicle 
for landscape-scale planting.
We envision unmanned ground vehicles
with seed printing systems planting
entire landscapes with algorithmic designs.
The team leads are Brendan Harmon and Hye Yeon Nam. 
This research was funded by an LSU Faculty Research Grant.

## Robotic Sensing

**Robotic Sensing** 
&nbsp;
We are exploring how robots 
-- from drones to unmanned ground vehicles -- 
can sense landscapes. 
We are studying how landscapes can be captured and represented
with technologies such as multispectral sensors,
real-time lidar, and radiance fields.

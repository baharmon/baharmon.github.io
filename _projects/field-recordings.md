**Field Recordings** is an expressive and documentary project by the XYZ Collective – an art and design collective recording spatial imaginaries of the American South. This project aims to preserve digital traces of Louisiana’s disappearing landscapes through 3D scanning and 3D printing. By scanning heritage sites across the state – including ancient trees and burial grounds – we captured spatial and aural characters of these landscapes in high fidelity. Our data is archived online so that future generations can learn about these landscapes. Field Recordings explores how machine vision sees and unsees our cultural landscapes, rendering material traces immaterial. We experimented with how these immaterial virtual artifacts can be rematerialized through digital fabrication. This project investigates the authoritative, yet imperfect nature of data captured through the lens of machine vision, asking how algorithms mediate meaning.

## Process

![Reconstruction Process](images/field-recordings-2.webp)

We use remote sensing techniques including drone lidar, terrestrial laser scanning, and neural rendering to record the spatial character of these landscapes. We also record spatial audio to capture their soundscapes. Then we use point cloud processing, volumetric modeling, and selective laser sintering 3D printing to reconstruct elements of the landscape. Tactile transducers embedded in the 3D prints transform them into speakers, immersing the audience in soundscape recordings from each. We also use the soundscapes to animate their point clouds.

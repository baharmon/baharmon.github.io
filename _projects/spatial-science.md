My research in spatial science focuses on the interaction between physical and ecological form and process. I model hydrology and erosion, develop computational models and simulations, and use remote sensing to record and analyze landscape dynamics.

## Hilltop Time Series Analysis

![Hilltop Meadow Point Cloud Rendering](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/baharmon/baharmon.github.io/master/images/spatial-science/hilltop-transect-biomass-2020.png)

[Hilltop Arboretum](https://xyz.cct.lsu.edu/hilltop/)
&nbsp;
A Cajun Prairie Wildflower Meadow was established in 2020 at the
[LSU Hilltop Arboretum](https://www.lsu.edu/hilltop/)
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Five fields have been restored as coastal tallgrass prairie,
a highly endangered ecosystem of which only one percent remains intact.
The evolution of the newly established meadow was recorded
with a series of monthly aerial surveys
by a drone with a multispectral sensor.
Net annual biomass and carbon
were computed from the time series of point clouds.
The surveys were conducted with a
FireFLY Pro 6 fixed wing drone
with a MicaSense RedEdge-M sensor
and 9 permanent ground control points.
This project was supported by the
LSU Center for GeoInformatics.
The datasets are released under the
<i class="fab fa-creative-commons"></i>
Creative Commons Zero
public domain dedication.

## Tangible Landscape

![Tangible Landscape](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/baharmon/baharmon.github.io/master/images/tangible-landscape-1.jpg)
[Tangible Landscape](https://tangible-landscape.github.io/)
is an open source tangible interface
for landscape modeling
powered by GRASS GIS and Blender.
Tangible Landscape couples
a physical and a digital model of a landscape
so that users can naturally feel, reshape, and interact
with the terrain.
This makes geospatial modeling
far more intuitive and accessible for beginners
and empowers geospatial experts.

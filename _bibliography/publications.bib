abstract = {We present new advances in the development of Tangible Geospatial Modeling System (TanGeoMS), an exploratory environment for analysis of relationships between elevation surface morphology and dynamic landscape processes. The system integrates digital terrain data and a flexible physical model with GRASS GIS-based analysis and simulation tools. The physical model can be modified by hand and scanned to create digital representations of altered landscapes within a GIS. The results of topographic analysis and GIS-based simulations applied to the modified landscape are then projected over the physical model, providing the users with feedback about the impact of the changes on the terrain parameters or modeled processes. The new prototype system replaced the costly laboratory laser scanner with a Kinect-based solution, making the system affordable, lighter and more flexible, while providing adequate accuracy and scanning speed. Advances in 3D printing and new modeling materials extended the techniques for building the physical models from a carved foam with plasticine surface to 3D printing or moulding from polymer-enriched sand for rapid 3D sketching. We demonstrate the system applications for analysis of terrain change impacts on selected processes in natural and engineered landscapes, and for testing simulation algorithms in various landscape configurations. The examples include overland water and sediment transport patterns modeled by standard flowrouting and unit stream power based method and by a robust particle sampling algorithm. Coastal terrain inundation and dynamics of solar irradiation under changing topographic conditions is also explored. The demonstration examples highlight the TanGeoMS application for collaborative explorations, communication of terrain change impacts and testing of algorithms for dynamic land surface process simulations.},

abstract = {While free and open source software becomes increasingly important in geospatial research and industry, open science perspectives are generally less reflected in universities' educational programs. We present an example of how free and open source software can be incorporated into geospatial education to promote open and reproducible science. Since 2008 graduate students at North Carolina State University have the opportunity to take a course on geospatial modeling and analysis that is taught with both proprietary and free and open source software. In this course, students perform geospatial tasks simultaneously in the proprietary package ArcGIS and the free and open source package GRASS GIS. By ensuring that students learn to distinguish between geospatial concepts and software specifics, students become more flexible and stronger spatial thinkers when choosing solutions for their independent work in the future. We also discuss ways to continually update and improve our publicly available teaching materials for reuse by teachers, self-learners and other members of the GIS community. Only when free and open source software is fully integrated into geospatial education, we will be able to encourage a culture of openness and, thus, enable greater reproducibility in research and development applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Geological Society of America. Chemical analyses from 71 watersheds across an {\~{}}450 km transect in west-central Panama provide insight into controls on weathering and rates of chemical denudation and CO2 consumption across an igneous arc terrain in the tropics. Stream and river compositions across this region of Panama are generally dilute, having a total dissolved solute value = 118 ± 91 mg/L, with bicarbonate and silica being the predominant dissolved species. Solute, stable isotope, and radiogenic isotope compositions are consistent with dissolution of igneous rocks present in Panama by meteoric precipitation, with geochemical signatures of rivers largely acquired in their upstream regions. Comparison of a headwater basin with its entire watershed observed considerably more runoff production from the high-elevation upstream portion of the catchment than in its much more spatially extensive downstream region. Rock alteration profiles document that weathering proceeds primarily by dissolution of feldspar and pyroxene, with base cations effectively leached in the following sequence: Na  {\textgreater}  Ca  {\textgreater}  Mg  {\textgreater}  K. Control on water chemistry by bedrock lithology is indicated through a linking of elevated ([Na + K]/[Ca + Mg] ) ratios in waters to a high proportion of catchment area silicic bedrock and low ratios to mafic bedrock. Sr-isotope ratios are dominated by basementderived Sr, with only very minor, if any, contribution from other sources. Cation weathering of Ca sil + Mg sil + Na + K spans about an order in magnitude, from 3 to 32 tons/km2/yr. Strong positive correlations of chemical denudation and CO2 consumption are observed with precipitation, mean watershed elevation, extent of land surface forest cover, and physical erosion rate.},

The military response to these challenges is, however, constrained by hierarchy and the culture of command and control. In a city, informal adaptations, experiments and solutions can arise to pressing urban issues that were unanticipated or unanswered by the formal city. By contrast, decisions and solutions in military installations have traditionally come down the chain of command. In an ever more complex world in which the future is ambiguous and change is a certainty, top-down decision making and the predictive sciences, alone, will not be enough to ensure a sustainable future.

abstract = {This study uses Danxiashan, a world heritage site in Guangdong province, China, as a case study for planning a hypothetical geotourism network of heritage sites. This landscape has a multiplicity of values—its geoheritage cannot be separated from its ecological or cultural heritage. When designing a network of heritage sites for such a diversely valued landscape trade-offs must be made between differing and potentially conflicting objectives such as geotourism and geoconservation. To solve this multi-criteria decision problem, sites with potential value for people were designated as heritage sites, adapting the concept of geomorphosites—i.e., geomorphological heritage sites—to represent the intersection of anthropic values. In a GIS-based spatial decision support system heritage values for each site were weighted and ranked using the analytic hierarchy pro- cess and scenarios for alternative trail systems, and networks of tourism sites were generated by multi-criteriamapoverlay analysis and networking algorithms. The scenarios generated show how trade-offs can be made between oft-conflicting tourism and conservation objectives, how the design of parks can be optimized for multiple objectives, and how alternative design strategies can be explored. Such an approach could be used in scenario planning workshops to engage stakeholders in participatory design and consensus- based decision-making driven by geospatial science.},

It couples a physical, three-dimensional model of a landscape with geospatial modeling and analysis through a cycle of scanning and projection. Multiple users can modify the physical model by hand while it is being scanned; by sculpting the model they generate input for modeling of geophysical processes. The modeling results are then visualized by projecting images or animations back on the physical model. This feedback loop is an intuitive way to evaluate the impacts of different scenarios including anthropogenic and natural landscape change. Integration with GRASS GIS, a free and open source geographic information system, provides TanGeoMS with a variety of easily accessible geospatial analysis and modeling tools. To demonstrate the environmental modeling applications of TanGeoMS, we will demonstrate how development can be planned based on feedback from landscape processes such as hydrologic simulation and wildfire modeling with variable fuel distribution.},

abstract = {Complex spatial forms like topography can be challenging to understand, much less intentionally shape, given the heavy cognitive load of visualizing and manipulating 3D form. Spatiotemporal processes like the flow of water over a landscape are even more challenging to understand and intentionally direct as they are dependent upon their context and require the simulation of forces like gravity and momentum. This cognitive work can be offloaded onto computers through 3D geospatial modeling, analysis, and simulation. Interacting with computers, however, can also be challenging, often requiring training and highly abstract thinking. Tangible computing - An emerging paradigm of human-computer interaction in which data is physically manifested so that users can feel it and directly manipulate it - Aims to offload this added cognitive work onto the body. We have designed Tangible Landscape, a tangible interface powered by an open source geographic information system (GRASS GIS), so that users can naturally shape topography and interact with simulated processes with their hands in order to make observations, generate and test hypotheses, and make inferences about scientific phenomena in a rapid, iterative process. Conceptually Tangible Landscape couples a malleable physical model with a digital model of a landscape through a continuous cycle of 3D scanning, geospatial modeling, and projection. We ran a flow modeling experiment to test whether tangible interfaces like this can effectively enhance spatial performance by offloading cognitive processes onto computers and our bodies. We used hydrological simulations and statistics to quantitatively assess spatial performance. We found that Tangible Landscape enhanced 3D spatial performance and helped users understand water flow.},

We introduce tangible immersion - virtual reality coupled with tangible interaction - to foster interdisciplinary collaboration in a critcal yet creative design process. Integratng tangible, embodied interaction with geospatial modeling and immersive virtual environments (IVE) can make 3D modeling fast and natural, while enhancing it with realistc graphics and quanttative analytcs. We have developed Tangible Landscape, a technology that links a physical model with a geographic information system and 3D-modeling platorm through a real-tme cycle of interaction, 3D scanning, geospatial computation, and 3D rendering. With this technology, landscape architects, other professionals, and the public can collaboratively explore design alternatives through an iterative process of intuitive ideation, geocomputational analysis, realistc rendering, and critcal analysis. This is demonstrated with a test case for interdisciplinary problem-solving, in which a landscape architect and geoscientst use Tangible Landscape to collaboratively design landforms, hydrologic systems, plantng, and a trail network for a brownfield site. Using this tangible immersive environment they rapidly explored alternative scenarios. We discuss how the partcipants used real-tme analytcs to collaboratively assess trade-offs between environmental and experiental factors, balancing landscape complexity, biodiversity, remediation capacity, and aesthetcs. Together they explored how the relationship between landforms and natural processes affected the performance of the designed landscape. Technologies that couple tangible geospatial modeling with IVEs have the potential to transform the design process by breaking down disciplinary boundaries, but may also offer new ways to imagine space and democratze design.},

abstract = {In this webinar we introduce Tangible Landscape - a new type of modeling environment for interacting with geospatial data, analyses and simulations using maleable 3D physical models. We will describe the concept, show various options for hardware set-ups in a laboratory or at outreach events,and discuss technologies for creating 3D landscape models. The system is powered by open source GRASS GIS and it is designed as a platform for developing new applications. We will illustrate its capabilities using case studies in which we have explored how dune breaches affect the extent of coastal flooding,the impact of different building configurations on cast shadows and solar energy potential, and the effectiveness of various landscape designs for controlling runoff and erosion.We will present different types of interaction including molding polymeric sand, placing markers,and drawing with laser pointer. We will demonstrate how these tangible interactions can be used for collaborative decision making or engaging geogames. The most recent (and exciting) development includes coupling tangible landscape with an immersive virtual environment, which allows users to virtually step into the modeled landscape. We will show Tangible Landscape in various settings such as outreach events and conferences engaging diverse audiences such as children, scientists, and software developers.We will conclude by introducing the Tangible Landscape on-line community and inviting everyone to join and share their own ideas about hardware set-ups, new applications, software development and modes of interaction.},

@article{tateosian2010,
abstract = {We present TanGeoMS, a tangible geospatial modeling visualization system that couples a laser scanner, projector, and a flexible physical three-dimensional model with a standard geospatial information system (GIS) to create a tangible user interface for terrain data. TanGeoMS projects an image of real-world data onto a physical terrain model. Users can alter the topography of the model by modifying the clay surface or placing additional objects on the surface. The modified model is captured by an overhead laser scanner then imported into a GIS for analysis and simulation of real-world processes. The results are projected back onto the surface of the model providing feedback on the impact of the modifications on terrain parameters and simulated processes. Interaction with a physical model is highly intuitive, allowing users to base initial design decisions on geospatial data, test the impact of these decisions in GIS simulations, and use the feedback to improve their design. We demonstrate the system on three applications: investigating runoff management within a watershed, assessing the impact of storm surge on barrier islands, and exploring landscape rehabilitation in military training areas.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). This paper presents novel and effective methods for teaching about topography- or shape of terrain- and assessing 3-dimensional spatial learning using tangibles. We used Tangible Landscape-a tangible interface for geospatial modeling- to teach multiple hands-on tangible lessons on the concepts of grading (i.e., earthwork), geomorphology, and hydrology. We examined students' ratings of the system's usability and user experience and tested students' acquisition and transfer of knowledge. Our results suggest the physicality of the objects enabled the participants to effectively interact with the system and each other, positively impacting ratings of usability and task-specific knowledge building. These findings can potentially advance the design and implementation of tangible teaching methods for the topics of geography, design, architecture, and engineering.},

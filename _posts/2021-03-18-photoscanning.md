### Photoscan of Martha's Screen

Nicholas Serrano and I are starting a project to
3D scan Rosedown Plantation in St. Francisville, Louisiana, USA.
We will use drone photogrammetry, terrestrial lidar, and RTK GPS
to capture to the house, gardens, and grounds.
We will also be scanning the interior of the house with lidar
and photoscanning historical artifacts.

### Rosedown Plantation

After a summer of laser scanning and drone photogrammetry,
we have recorded Rosedown Plantation and its grounds
as a set of point clouds.
In September we presented our work 3D scanning the plantation
at the Southeast Chapter of the Society of Architectural Historians'
annual conference ([SESAH 2021](https://sesah.org/))
in Natchez, Mississippi.
Our server [xyz.cct.lsu.edu](https://xyz.cct.lsu.edu/)
with Potree point cloud viewers is live.

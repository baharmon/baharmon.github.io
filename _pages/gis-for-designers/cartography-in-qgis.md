and <i class="ms ms-line"></i> vector data
of the world in the
[Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) collection.
Download and extract:

The <i class="ms ms-sphere"></i> coordinate reference system
for these datasets is the
World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84).
Move these datasets to
a new <i class="ms ms-directory"></i> directory
on your computer called `natural_earth`.

## Import and Package Data

Start QGIS with an empty project.
In QGIS' Browser browse
to your <i class="ms ms-directory"></i>
`natural_earth` directory.
Consider adding it to your favorites.
Right click on the `natural_earth` directory
to create a new
<i class="ms ms-database"></i> GeoPackage
called `natural-earth-from-space.gpkg`.
Then save the current project as
`natural-earth-from-space.gqz`
in the `natural_earth` directory.

In QGIS' Browser drag and drop
the following into `natural-earth-from-space.gpkg`:
* `ne_50m_graticules_15`
* `ne_10m_admin_0_countries`
* `ne_10m_lakes`
* `ne_10m_rivers_lake_centerlines_scale_rank`
* `ne_10m_rivers_europe`
* `NE1_50M_SR_W.tif`
* `NE1_LR_LC_SR_W_DR.tif`

This will import these data into
the <i class="ms ms-database"></i> GeoPackage
dataset for more efficient storage
and easier portability.
In QGIS' browser double click
on the data in the GeoPackage
to add them to the map.

Start by turning off all layers
except for the countries and graticules.
Style the countries with a simple fill
with fill color set to grey,
stroke color set to white,
and a stroke width of 0.2.
Style the graticules with a simple line
in black with a stroke weight of 0.3.

## Azimuth Orthographic Projection

Locator maps simply show where a project located.
They can be inset in more detailed maps to
establish a wider context.
Use an <i class="ms ms-sphere"></i>
azimuth orthographic projection
to create a globe for an inset map.
First set a predefined azimuth orthographic projection.
In the project menu, select properties.
In the properties dialog, select the CRS tab
and search for the `The_World_From_Space` projection.
Copy the PROJ definition for this projection.
You will use it to make a custom projection
in the next step.

To set a custom azimuth orthographic projection
centered on your study area,
go to the settings menu
and select custom projection.
Use the plus button to create a new CRS,
name it `Custom_World_From_Space`,
set the format to proj string,
paste the PROJ definition for the
`The_World_From_Space`,
and then edit it.
Adjust `lat_0` and `lon_0`,
the latitude and longitude
of natural origin
to focus on your study area.
```
+proj=ortho +lat_0=42.5333333333 +lon_0=-0.5 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=sphere +units=m +no_defs
```
Back in project properties in the CRS tab,
search for your new `Custom_World_From_Space` projection
and set it as the CRS.
Then in the custom CRS dialog,
try adjusting the Latitude and Longitude
of natural origin value to rotate the globe
until it centers on your study area.
For this tutorial, focus on Europe.

Try turning off the
<i class="ms ms-polygon"></i>
`ne_10m_admin_0_countries`
vector layer
and turning on the
<i class="ms ms-raster"></i>
`NE1_50M_SR_W`
raster layer.

## Extract a Continent

Extract a vector map of Europe from
<i class="ms ms-polygon"></i>
`ne_10m_admin_0_countries`
to show your study area on the locator map.
In the `Plugins` menu
select manage and install plugins.
In the `Plugins` window
check the `Processing` plugin.
This is a core plugin
so it does not need to be installed,
but it does need to be activated.
The [spatial data processing framework for QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/processing/index.html)
has algorithms for geospatial computation.
A panel with the `Processing Toolbox`
should appear on the right side
of your main QGIS window.
In the `Processing Toolbox` browse
in `Vector Selection` for
`Extract by attribute`.
Run [Extract by attribute](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorselection.html#extract-by-attribute).
Set the input layer to `ne_50m_admin_0_countries`, set the selection attribute to `CONTINENT`, set the value to `Europe`, and set the matching features to `ogr:dbname='natural_earth.gpkg' table="europe" (geom)`.
Nota bene: use the full file path for `natural_earth.gpkg`.

## Themes

You can save different arrangements
and styling of layers as themes.
Themes are very useful for setting up
print layouts with multiple maps
with different styles.
To <i class="ms ms-style"></i> style
the locator map
differently than the main map,
create a theme for each.

Set up a theme for the locator map.
For example arrange the following layers
in order from top to bottom:
* `ne_50m_graticules_15`
* `europe`
* `NE1_50M_SR_W.tif`

Style the graticules as simple line in white.
Optionally, set graticules' opacity to 50%.
Style `europe` with a simple fill
with a blue fill and a dark blue stroke.
Create a new map theme by
selecting the manage map themes button
in the layers manager.
Choose add theme to create
a new theme called `globe`.

Set up a theme for a
map of rivers in Europe.
For example arrange the following layers
in order from top to bottom:
* `ne_10m_lakes`
* `ne_10m_rivers_europe`
* `ne_10m_rivers_lake_centerlines_scale_rank`
* `NE1_LR_LC_SR_W_DR`

Style lakes with a blue sampled
<i class="ms ms-color-picker"></i>
from the ocean  in the Natural Earth raster
with a transparent stroke.
Style the supplemental European rivers
with a blue stroke with a weight of 0.075.
Style the rivers with blue strokes
weighted based on stream order.
Set a data defined override
for the stroke width.
In the data defined assistant
set the source to `strokeweig`,
refresh the input values,
and set the output value size from
0.1 to 1.25.
Consider adding labels for the larger rivers.
Create a new map theme by
selecting the manage map themes button
in the layers manager.
Choose add theme to create
a new theme called `map`.

## Print Layout

In the project menu
select `new print layout`
and create a new layout
called `rivers-of-europe`.
The print layout window will open
with a blank canvas.
In print layout create
a <i class="ms ms-map"></i>
map of European rivers in a projection
such as Lambert Conformal Conic
with an <i class="ms ms-globe"></i>
inset locator map
in an azimuth orthographic projection.

Use the add map button in the toolbar
on the left side of the print layout
to draw a new map canvas.
First add a map spanning the whole canvas.
In the items panel,
select and rename this as `map`.
In the item properties panel
under the main properties section
set the CRS to a projection such as
`Europe_Lambert_Conformal_Conic`.
Set a fixed scale such as 15000000.
Then in the layers section
check follow map theme
and set the theme to `map`.

Add a scale bar your map.
Select it in the item panel,
then in the item properties panel
set the style to numeric.

To create the inset locator map
add another map to the canvas.
Click the add map button and
drag and drop a small square window
in the upper left corner of the canvas.
In the items panel,
select and rename this as `inset`.
In the item properties panel
under the main properties section
set the CRS to `Custom_World_From_Space`.
Set a fixed scale such as 200000000.
Then in the layers section
check follow map theme
and set the theme to `globe`.
Uncheck `background` to hide
the white background behind your globe.

Finally use the export as image button
to export your map as a `.jpg` <i class="ms ms-img"></i>.

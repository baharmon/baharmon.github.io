### Poemform

**Team:** Brendan Harmon, Hye Yeon Nam, Vincent Celluci, and Zak Berkowitz.


Poemform is an interactive bench derived from the waveform
of the poem Diamonds in Dystopia.
Embedded surface transducers so that it becomes a sound system,
the bench will play a different line of poem
depending upon where you sit.
It represents the following three lines from Vincent Celluci's poem
[Diamonds in Dystopia](https://github.com/baharmon/waveforms/blob/master/poemform/text/diamonds-in-dystopia.pdf):

```
irrigating minds

the one prototype for change
   more giving systems
```

### Loveform

**Team:** Hye Yeon Nam and Brendan Harmon.

Loveform is an interactive, 3D printed ceramic cup
derived from the waveform of a message.
The cups recites its recorded message when it is drunk from.
The first pair of cups represents and recites the message:
```
I love you.
```

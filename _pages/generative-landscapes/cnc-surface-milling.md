## CNC Surface Milling

Use computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling
to digitally fabricate a topographic model
in Rhino with the
[RhinoCAM](https://mecsoft.com/rhinocam/) plugin.
Download the Rhino model
[<i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i>](https://github.com/baharmon/generative-design/raw/main/digital-fabrication/models/cnc-surface-milling.3dm)
for this tutorial.
This model was generated by the Grasshopper definition
[trigonometric-landforms.gh](https://github.com/baharmon/generative-design/raw/main/grasshopper/trigonometric-landforms.gh).
This tutorial is written for a 3-axis
[Forest Scientific CNC Router](https://forestscientific.com/cnc-routers/)
using `VelocityCNCmill` as the post processor.

## Machine Setup

Start Rhino and set the units to `Inches`.
In the RhinoCAM menu switch to the `MILL` module for CNC milling.
In RhinoCAM's Machining Browser in the `Program` tab
use the default `3 Axis` machine.
In `Post` set the post processor to `VelocityCNCmill`.
Set the posted file extension to a `.nc` numeric control file.

## Stock

The stock for this CNC milling exercise
is a 6" x 6" x 2" block of
high-density urethane (HDU) foam board
such as [Renshape](https://www.freemansupply.com/products/machinable-media)
or [Signfoam](http://www.signfoam.com/).

In RhinoCAM's Machining Browser in the `Program` tab
in `Stock` select `Box Stock`
and set the dimensions to 6" long, 6" wide, and 2" high.
In `Align` select `Align Stock`
and set Z alignment to `Top`
and XY alignment to `South West`.
Then in In `Align` select `Set World C.S.`
and set the origin to the stock box,
set the zero face to `Highest Z`,
and the zero position to `South West`.

## Tools

In the Machining Objects panel create a new tool.
This will be a ball end mill made of carbide
with a 0.25" diameter and 2 flutes.
The feed rate and speed depend
on the tool, stock, and machining operation.
Set the tool type to `Ball Mill`,
tool length to `3.25`,
shoulder length to `1.75`,
flute length to `1.5`,
and the tool diameter to `0.25`.
In the properties tab
set the material to carbide
and the number of flutes to `2`.
In the feeds and speeds tab
set the speed to `15000` RPM,
plunge to `20`,
approach to `180`,
engage to `180`,
cut to `200`,
retract to `180`,
and departure to `180`.
Save the tool.
Alternatively in the Machining Objects panel load the
[cnc_surface_tools.csv](https://github.com/baharmon/generative-design/raw/main/digital-fabrication/data/cnc_surface_tools.csv)
tool library.

**Feeds & Speeds**

| Speed | Plunge | Approach | Cut | Retract | Departure |
|:-----:|:------:|:--------:|:---:|:-------:|:---------:|
| 15000 | 20     | 180      | 200 | 180     | 180       |

## Machining Operations

In the Machining Browser in the `Program` tab
in `Machining Operations` under
`3-Axis Advanced` select
`Parallel Finishing`.
In the tool tab select the 0.25" ball end mill.
In the feeds and speeds tab load the settings from the tool.
In cut parameters set the stepover to 25% of the tool diameter.
Generate the toolpath.
Then right click on the parallel finishing operation
and select post to export the toolpath
as a `.nc` numerical control file.
Save the numerical control file to a USB drive
to load onto the computer connected to the CNC machine.

## Simulation

In the `Simulation` tab of the Machining Browser
under `Simulate` select `Play`
to simulate the machining operation in Rhino's viewports.
